1. 1995 – The Birth of JavaScriptCreated by: Brendan Eich at Netscape.
Originally called: Mocha, then LiveScript, finally renamed JavaScript for marketing reasons (to ride on Java’s popularity).
Goal: Add interactivity to web pages (like pop-ups, form validation).
Runs in browser only — no server-side usage yet.

2. 1996–1999 – Standardization Begins
Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International to create a standard.
The standard version is called ECMAScript.
ECMAScript 1 (ES1) released in 1997 — first official version.
ECMAScript 3 (ES3) in 1999 — introduced:
try...catch error handling
regular expressions
better string handling
This version became the foundation for years.

3. 2000–2008 – Stagnation & Browser Wars
Internet Explorer, Netscape, and others had incompatible JavaScript engines.
Developers struggled with cross-browser bugs.
AJAX (2005) appeared → allowed updating parts of web pages without reload → enabled apps like Gmail and Google Maps.
This revived interest in JavaScript for building interactive web apps.

4. 2009 – ECMAScript 5 (ES5)
Released after 10 years of silence.
Added major improvements:
JSON support
Array methods (forEach, map, filter, etc.)
strict mode ("use strict";)
Widely adopted by all browsers.
