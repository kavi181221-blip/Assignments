                    <h4>Now start to cooking :</h4>
                </u></b>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly until water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes while you prepare other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Wash and pat dry the chicken pieces.</li>
                <li>Make a paste of ginger and garlic (about 2 tablespoons).</li>
                <li>Finely slice 2 large onions into thin rings.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a skillet and fry half the onions until golden brown; drain and set aside (for garnish).
                </li>
                <li>In a bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, coriander
                    powder, salt, and lemon juice.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken pieces to the yogurt marinade and coat well.</li>
                <li>Marinate the chicken for at least 1 hour (overnight gives best results).</li>
                <li>Chop tomatoes into small pieces and keep aside.</li>
                <li>Chop cilantro (coriander) and mint leaves and set aside.</li>
                <li>Soak a pinch of saffron in 2 tablespoons of warm milk and set aside to infuse color.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add salt and whole spices (bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves,
                    green cardamom, black peppercorns).</li>
                <li>Drain the soaked rice and add to boiling water; cook until rice is 70% done (grains should still
                    have a slight bite).</li>
                <li>Drain rice and spread on a tray to stop cooking.</li>
                <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot (dutch oven), heat ghee and a tablespoon of oil.</li>
                <li>Add whole spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves) and let them sizzle for a few seconds.</li>
                <li>Add chopped onions (the remaining half) and sauté until translucent.</li>
                <li>Add marinated chicken to the pot and sear on medium-high heat for 4–6 minutes to lock flavors.</li>
                <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they break down and oil separates.</li>
                <li>Check seasoning and add salt if needed.</li>
                <li>Add chopped cilantro and mint to the chicken layer and mix lightly.</li>
                <li>Lower heat to medium and add half of the partially cooked rice over the chicken to create the first
                    layer.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle some fried onions, chopped mint, and cilantro on top of the rice layer.</li>
                <li>Drizzle half of the saffron milk and a tablespoon of ghee over the rice layer.</li>
                <li>Carefully add the remaining rice to form the second layer.</li>
                <li>Top the rice with the remaining fried onions, mint, cilantro, and saffron milk.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If the lid isn't tight, seal edges with dough to trap steam
                    (optional).</li>
                <li>Place a griddle/tawa on medium heat and put the pot on top (this prevents direct heat and avoids
                    burning).</li>
                <li>Cook on low heat (dum) for 25–30 minutes to let flavors meld and rice finish cooking.</li>
                <li>After 20 minutes, check aroma; add a few drops of rose water or kewra water for extra fragrance
                    (optional).</li>
                <li>Once done, turn off the heat and let the pot rest for 10 minutes before opening.</li>
                <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix layers without breaking rice.</li>
                <li>Serve biryani on a large platter and garnish with toasted nuts (optional).</li>
                <li>Accompany with raita (yogurt-cucumber), lemon wedges, and salad.</li>
                <li>Leftovers: store in refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 2 days.</li>
                <li>Reheating tip: sprinkle a little water and heat covered on low until warm, or microwave with a damp
                    paper towel for 1–2 minutes.</li>
                <li>For vegetarian version, substitute chicken with mixed vegetables or paneer and follow same method.
                </li>
                <li>To make the biryani spicier, increase green chilies and red chili powder in the marinade.</li>
                <li>To reduce oil, use less ghee and more non-stick cooking spray while frying onions.

            <h1>Fish Fry</h1>
        </b></center>
    <hr>
    <h4><u>ingredients</u></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>500 g fish fillets or whole fish (cleaned and patted dry) — e.g., tilapia, pomfret, or mackerel</li>
        <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1½ tsp red chili powder or paprika (milder option)</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder or 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger paste (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon or lime juice</li>
        <li>3 tbsp rice flour, cornflour, or all-purpose flour (for a light crust)</li>
        <li>2–3 tbsp oil for frying (vegetable/peanut/sunflower)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro or lemon wedges for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><u>Start to make the food</u></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the fish and pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Make shallow slits on both sides of whole fish (if using fillets, score lightly).</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix turmeric, salt, red chili powder, black pepper, garlic, ginger (if using), and lemon juice to
            form a marinade.</li>
        <li>Rub the marinade all over the fish, getting it into the slits/edges. Let it rest for 15–30 minutes. (If
            short on time, you can fry immediately.)</li>
        <li>Just before frying, lightly dust the fish with the flour of your choice—this helps form a crisp outer layer.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Test with a small piece of batter or a small scrap of fish —
            it should sizzle.</li>
        <li>Place the fish gently into the pan. Fry for about 3–5 minutes per side (depending on thickness) until golden
            and cooked through. Avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
        <li>When cooked, transfer to a rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro and lemon wedges. Serve hot with rice, salad, or chutney.</li>
    </ol>
