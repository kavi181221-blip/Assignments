        My technical interest is in web development, especially building online shopping websites. I am fascinated by
        creating an online dress shop where users can browse products, view images, and check prices. I enjoy styling
        web pages with CSS to make them attractive and responsive. I also like adding interactive features with
        JavaScript, such as adding items to a cart. My goal is to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a fully
        functional online shopping experience.My technical interest is in web development, especially building online
